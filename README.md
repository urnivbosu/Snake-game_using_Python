# Snake-game_using_Python
This is a Snake Game using the Python Turtle Graphics library. The game involves controlling a snake on the screen to eat fruits that appear randomly while avoiding colliding with the borders or its own body. The score increases for each fruit eaten, and the game ends when the snake collides with the borders or its own body.
